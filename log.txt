avoiding deadlock
prefer locking single mutex
avoid locking a mutex and then calling a user provided function
use std:: lock() to lock more than one mutex
lock the mutex in same order

locking granularity
fine grained lock : protects small amount of data
coarse grained lock : protects big amount of data
